Scientific Motivation and Goal
- Several methods have been proposed for generating salience maps, including gradient-based methods, perturbation-based methods, and activation-based methods. -> could we add a reference here?
- This is because there are often multiple valid interpretations of a given input, and what might be salient to one observer may not be salient to another -> do you have a source for this? indeed it might differ for different people, but we do not really want to capture what (human) observers find salient, but rather the model we investigate






Results
- I would suggest a slight restructuring of this. Referring to the plot first thing in the section is again quite a jump. Maybe you could start with talking about what we would expect to happen when removing certain percentages, both for a random baseline as well as a more advanced method? Similar to what you did in A. Are the results meaningful?. 
- Continuing with section A: this is basically a direct quote, which would require "" etc - direct quotes, in particular as long as this paragraph, should be avoided in scientific writing if possible. Maybe you could try to summarise it in your own words, and make it a 'regular' citation ([1])? 
- After talking about what we expect, you can refer to the figure / table and explain them briefly in the text. Then you can interpret the results, i.e. talk about how IG performs in contrast to the baseline, and how the standard deviations change etc (like is done in B). 
- I personally would be careful with using terms like 'proof' when it's not really a proof, and 'significant' if we didn't do a statistical significance test (unless you did one :)). 
- If you are still looking for something to add to your report, you could include a brief analysis in how your results compare to the ROAR paper, and/or what your next steps could be.
